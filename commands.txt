#Multitenant Setup
Assuming that you've already got your first site running and you've performed the production deployment steps, this section explains how to host your second site (and more). Your first site is automatically set as default site. You can change it with the command,
bench use sitename

#Port based multitenancy
Create a new site
	bench new-site site2namebench setup nginx
Set port
	bench set-nginx-port site2name 8082
Re generate nginx config
	bench setup nginx
Reload nginx
	sudo service nginx reload

#DNS based multitenancy
You can name your sites as the hostnames that would resolve to it. Thus, all the sites you add to the bench would run on the same port and will be automatically selected based on the hostname.

DNS based multitenancy mode is disabled by default, you can switch it on / off using the command,
	bench config dns_multitenant on

To make a new site under DNS based multitenancy, perform the following steps.

Create a new site
	bench new-site site2name

Re generate nginx config
	bench setup nginx

Reload nginx
	sudo service nginx reload

Note : For "DNS based multitenancy", currentsite.txt in frappe-bench/sites/ should be empty.
